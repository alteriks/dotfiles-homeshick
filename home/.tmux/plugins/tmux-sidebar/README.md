# Tmux Sidebar

`tmux-sidebar` does one thing: it opens a tree directory listing for the current
path. It's fast, convenient and works great with vim.

Some of the features that make the plugin more appealing than doing the same
thing manually each time:

- **fast**<br/>
  Much faster than doing each step manually.
- **smart sizing**<br/>
  Sidebar remembers its size, so the next time you open it, it will have the
  **exact same** width. This is a per-directory property, so you can have just
  the right size for multiple dirs.
- **toggling**<br/>
  The same key binding opens and closes the sidebar.
- **uninterrupted workflow**<br/>
  The main `prefix + Tab` key binding opens a sidebar but **does not** move
  cursor to it.
- **pane layout stays the same**<br/>
  No matter which pane layout you prefer, sidebar tries hard not to mess your
  pane splits. Open, then close the sidebar and everything should look the same.

Requirements: `tmux 1.9` or higher, `tree` recommended but not required

### Key bindings

- `prefix + Tab` - toggle sidebar with a directory tree
- `prefix + Backspace` - toggle sidebar and move cursor to it (focus it)

### Installation with [Tmux Plugin Manager](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) (recommended)

Add plugin to the list of TPM plugins in `.tmux.conf`:

    set -g @tpm_plugins "          \
      tmux-plugins/tpm             \
      tmux-plugins/tmux-sidebar    \
    "

Hit `prefix + I` to fetch the plugin and source it. You should now be able to
use the plugin.

### Manual Installation

Clone the repo:

    $ git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-sidebar ~/clone/path

Add this line to the bottom of `.tmux.conf`:

    run-shell ~/clone/path/sidebar.tmux

Reload TMUX environment:

    # type this in terminal
    $ tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf

You should now be able to use the plugin.
